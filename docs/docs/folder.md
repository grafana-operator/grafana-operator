Dashboard folders is a good way to manage your dashboards.
By default a folder can be created in a dashboard, but if you want to add rbac settings to a folder you need to use the grafanafolder CR.

To view all configuration you can do within folders look at our [API documentation](../api/#grafanafolderspec).
